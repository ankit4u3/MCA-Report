I was expecting to see something like `(' or `\{' or
`\}' here. If you typed, e.g., `{' instead of `\{', you
should probably delete the `{' by typing `1' now, so that
braces don't get unbalanced. Otherwise just proceed.
Acceptable delimiters are characters whose \delcode is
nonnegative, or you can use `\delimiter <delimiter code>'.

With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have

spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
